# CVmill &mdash; Well Crafted Resumes

CVmill Templates are a set of resume designs. They were originally used as templates by CVmill.com - a startup out of India that was founded in 2015, and shut down in 2018.

*All the templates are created in Adobe InDesign, and free for public use.*

#### Why did we create these templates:
We noticed a common trend in the resumes that were being used by family, friends and a lot of other job applicants. Almost everyone was using the same look-a-like resume â€” they were all poorly designed, had very little structure and failed to effectively highlight what employers would have been interested in.

We also noticed that as soon as an employer or recruiter saw a well designed resume, they always offered compliments and that connected very well with our mission.

Enjoy!
